Tasks remaining
(replaces Google doc, for the sake of working offline)
--------------------------------
Urgent housekeeping
    delete database again
    enter a minimal database and export a fixture
    put ideas for more database items in a doc

TBD
    what happens to accepted and unaccepted offers? are we keeping a history?

Notes for later
    only the owner of the ware can see the list of offers on it (a la Neopets TP)

Functionality
    CRUD views for archive pages and events
        link to them, but hide the links from non-privileged users
        think through each of CRUD with each model
        only Webmasters can delete anything or update roles
    Make a bug report model (start with a separate app to put it in)

Content
    Design council member bio format
    Mission statement on membership page

Users and permissions
    Add users with varying permissions to the database; put an explanation of these in the README

Look and feel
    Restyle from scratch
    Limit the width of the page

Testing
    Permissions functional tests
    Unit tests (??)

Documentation
    Docstrings
    Look up what needs to go in a README
    Edit settings.py; perhaps split into settings/__init__.py and settings/base.py

Polish
    Confirm that everything fits PEP-8 and the Django style guide
